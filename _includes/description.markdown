My name is Kacper Sokołowski and I am based in the beautiful city of Kraków, Poland. I am a front-end developer for the award-winning adtech company - [Codewise][codewise] <3. 

Apart from that I am also an organiser for one of the biggest JS communities in Poland - [KrakówJS][krakow-js]. I also speak at different JS conferences around the world. If you want to have me, please email me at {{site.email}}.
